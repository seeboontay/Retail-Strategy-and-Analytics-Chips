# Retail-Strategy-and-Analytics-Chips
Data analysis on customer segments
We can define some metrics of interest to the client:
• Who spends the most on chips (total sales), describing customers by lifestage and how premium their
general purchasing behaviour is
• How many customers are in each segment
• How many chips are bought per customer by segment
• What’s the average chip price by customer segment
We could also ask our data team for more information. Examples are:
• The customer’s total spend over the period and total spend for each transaction to understand what
proportion of their grocery spend is on chips
• Proportion of customers in each customer segment overall to compare against the mix of customers
who purchase chips
